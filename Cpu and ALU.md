The Central Processing Unit and Arithmetical Logical Unit (CPU and ALU)

It is common practice in computer science for the words ‘computer’ and
‘processor’ to be used interchangeably. More precisely, ‘computer’ refers to the
central processing unit (CPU) together with an internal memory. The internal
memory, control and processing components make up the heart of the computer
system. Manufactures design the CPU to control and carry out basic instructions
for their particular computer.

In digital computers the CPU can be divided into two functional units cailed
the control unit (CU) and the arithmetical-logical unit (ALU). These two units are
made up of electronic circuits with millions of switches that can be one of two
states, either on or off.

The function of the control unit within the central process is to transmit
coordinating control signals and commands. The control unit is that portion of the
computer that directs the sequence or step-by-step operation of the system, selects
instructions and data from memory, interprets the program instructions, and
controls the flow between main storage and the arithmetical-logical unit.

The arithmetical-logical unit (ALU) is that portion of the computer in which the arithmetical operations, namely, addition, substraction, multiplication,
devesion, and exponentiation, called for in the instructions are performed.

1.
2. In digital computers the CPU can be divided into two functional units called the control unit (CU) and the arithmetical-logical unit (ALU)
3. The function of the CU is to transmit coordinating control signals and commands.
4. CU is a component of a CPU. Components - instruction registers, control signals within the CPU, control signals to/from the bus, control bus, input flags,
   and clock signals.
5. ALU is components of computer in which perform selection of operations.
